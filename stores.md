##How do free-to-play games orient customers to ingame stores?

This page is an exploration of the different storefronts featured in games that sell virtual goods. The majority of these games only allow virtual goods (ingame items) to be purchased with virtual currencty. The virtual currency can either be earned or purchased, though in games with more than one virtual currency there is typically a currency that can only be purchased.

###FarmVille
FarmVille's storefront has a cluttered interface. There are two distinct currencies, a button to purchase both, and a button for special offers. Items are sorted by category, and have a clear name, cost, and appearance. Items can only be purchased with virutal currencies, which in turn can be purchased with real currency.

###FarmVille 2
FarmVille 2's storefront is a marked improvement. Each item has a clear set of attributes, complete with an image of the item. Items are organized by categories, which are represented by icons at the top, and can also be searched for. There is only one clear ingame curency from this screenshot, another reduction of complexity and clutter in the interface. Items can only be purchased with virutal currencies, which in turn can be purchased with real currency.

###Clash of Clans
Clash of Clans' storefront has a very clear interface. The three different currencies are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Items are divided into categories in a touch friendly way, with each category being a subpage of the main storefront. Items have several attributes, the most important of which is their cost.

###Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft
Hearthstone's storefront has a slightly cluttered interface. In the card purchasing section there are two types of packs, each of which can be purchased in varying quantities. There is a clear description of the contents of each pack. There is a second section to purchase adventures, which has another two types, corresponding to the two adventure expansions to the game.
These virtual goods can be purchased with virtual or real currency.

###World of Warcraft
World of Warcraft's storefront has a simple interface. There are only three categories, one of which is simply a featured item. The price is clearly displayed in real currency, along with an ingame representaion of the item.

###League of Legends
League of Legends' storefront is cluttered. It is built into the main page of the game launcher, and features a sale item, a featured item, and a list of top sellers and new items. Items are divided into categories, and can be purchased with one of two virtual currencies, which in turn can be purchased with real currency.
