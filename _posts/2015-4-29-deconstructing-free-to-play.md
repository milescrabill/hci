>Let me tell you what free to play represents to me: an opportunity to bring entertainment to billions of people without relying on advertising revenue or government subsidies. An opportunity to embrace players who want to play our games but can't (or won't) pay, instead of forcing them to become pirates.
> 
>An opportunity to stop making disposable entertainment experiences and instead create games that live forever, supported by devoted fans who happily spend money to keep their favorite hobby alive.
>
>For the first time in the history of mass media, we can entertain huge audiences without first bombarding them with advertisements for sugar water and corn flakes and without making them pirates. How is it that some people don't see the beauty of this? <cite>--_David Edery, "The Magic of Free-to-Play" (2012)_</cite>


As the end user, Free-to-Play sounds too good to be true. Instead of paying for a game, you can just play it. After all, when the only cost to you is your time, what's the harm?

##The Free-to-Play Business Model

###The Concept

- No fee for entry and basic gameplay
- In-game content sold for a fee

###The Advantages

- Increased userbase, creating a positive network effect
- Users can decide whether or not to pay for the experience
- Users can decide how much to pay, if the game offers varying items and price points
- Paid goods are inherently valuable as non-paying users lack them
- The game itself is a service able to be iteratively modified

##Virtual Items

The exchange of real money for virtual goods first occurred in 1999 in the games _Ultima Online_ and _EverQuest_, when players sold items to one another on eBay, utilizing the free market within the games. The evolution of the virtual goods market has been shift from player to player selling to operator to player selling (Hamari & Lehdonvirta, 2010). This shift has supported a change in revenue model from subscription model games to free to play games. A study of the pricing models of MMO games in Japan conducted in 2005-2006 shows a dramatic shift from monthly the fixed fee subscription models to the per-item virtual goods billing (Nojima, 2007).

**Pricing models of MMO/MO in Japan by number of titles** <cite>--_Nojima (2007), reproduced_</cite>

| Pricing Models | Sep. 2005 | Oct. 2006 |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Monthly fixed fee   | 30 (50.8%)   | 20 (22.5)   |
| Per-item billing   | 19 (32.2%)   | 53 (59.6)   |
| Complex   | 10 (17.0%)   | 16 (17.9%)   |

Nojima shows that players who buy virtual items are more immersed in the games. Do they buy items because they are immersed, or are they immersed because they buy items?

Lehdonvirta (2005) identifies ten different user perceptions on real money trading through a case study of _Ultima Online_, _EverQuest_, _Habbo Hotel_, and _Project Entropia_, four different MMOs. It is important to note that these games fall into different categories. In the study, _Ultima Online_ and _EverQuest_ both require subscriptions, whereas _Habbo Hotel_ and _Project Entropia_ are free-to-play games.

| Achievement | Social | Immersion |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
|**Advancement**: if RMT enables purchase of rewards, it violates the achievement hierarchy|**Socializing**: RMT allows players to express themselves through their buying behavior|**Discovery**: breaks the magic circle, but gives more choice over content|
|**Mechanics**: RMT makes it easier to obtain different asset configurations to examine|**Relationship**: RMT allows those with less time to catch up and play together with their friends|**Role-Playing**: RMT allows players to obtain the props that are needed for their chosen fantasy|
|**Competition**: RMT is cheating if it can be used to obtain competitive advantages|**Teamwork**: RMT provides objectives for teamwork and motivation for effective organization|**Customization**: RMT makes it easier to obtain a set of assets that correspond to the player's taste|
|             |        |**Escapism**: RMT breaks the magic circle by introducing real-life worries into the virtual world|

##Social Games

The term "social games" refers to the distribution channel these games utilize. Social games are played over social network services, adapting friendships for gameplay and social network use. Facebook kickstarted the social games industry in 2007 by opening third-party developer tools on its site through the Facebook Developer Platform. (Paavilainen, Hamari, Stenros, Kinnunen, 2013)

Paavilainen et al. (2013) argue that social games are in essence casual games. They typically adhere to the four design values of casual games, namely _acceptability, accessibility, simplicity, and flexibility_ described by Kultima (2009). As an example, Zynga's FarmVille (2009) is an inoffensive, accessible browser game that is simple to understand and play. Social games provide a platform for social interaction in the context of a game that supports sporadic play.

> Social interaction is further encouraged by reciprocal actions such as sending and receiving gifts. Game mechanics are tied into the playersâ€™ social network, thus fostering collaboration and competition in the social network.

##The Value of Virtual Goods

- Individualize avatars with decorative items
- Increase avatar's abilities

##Game Mechanics That Sell Virtual Goods

Selling virtual goods requires a value proposition. 
The primary value proposition that game developers use to sell virtual goods is stratification. 

###Stratification

Content is stratified by player level, by payment, and more. An example of stratified content in MMOs is the leveling up proess of the player's avatar. Vertically segmenting players allows items to be targeted according to stratification (Hamari & Lehdonvirta, 2010).

###Status Restrictions

Content is restricted to those who fulfill certain criteria, therefore enforcing differentiation. In a social game, this could take the effect of logging in repeatedly to maintain the status of something already earned, such as a farm in FarmVille.

>The operator forces players to obtain new items iteratively if they wish to maintain the same relative performance or status. This mechanism could be compared to regulations in karate belts, which can officially be worn only when the karateka has achieved the appropriate status. <cite>--_Hamari & Lehdonvirta (2010)_</cite>

###Artificial Scarcity

Games that create an environment where avatars and accounts can be compared between users almost always integrate artificial scarcity. Rare, collectible items are status symbols that ascibre value to virtual items in the virtual world. Artificial scarcity inflates the value of virtual items out of proportion, creating a value proposition for real money trading.

##Explaining Customer Behavior in Relation to Free-to-Play

>The way of monetizing game content like free to play games do is new to industry and scholars. There is only little research on how those games work and there are no concepts that can empirically explain the cus- tomer behavior in free to play games. <cite>--_Hanner & Zarnekow (2015)_</cite>

This research is relatively new, concerning the Free-to-Play / freemium business model. Here are some of the findings from Hanner & Zarnekow (2015), who analyzed three different free to play mobile games, each published by a different publisher. Each game sells a premium currency that can be used to purchase virtual items.

- users who started purchasing showed an increased retention rate for following purchases
- the average value spent per purchase increases with the number of repeat purchases

Some of the ideas discussed by Hanner & Zarnekow (2015) that are supported by Hamari & Lehdonvirta (2010) are particularly relevant to HCI:

- monetizing users too soon risks pressuring the user before they are immersed in the virtual world
- a dynamic presentation of virtual items depending on the stage of a user (stratification) could improve monetization.

The HCI concepts here are loosely veiled: users want to be a part of the virtual world, and a request for payment derails their immersion. Even more directly, the way that virtual item offers are presented likely affects user spending - so a better purchasing interface will result in more money!

You never have to worry about buying a game only to have it sit on your shelf collecting dust.
