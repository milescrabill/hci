Welcome to Miles's HCI Spring 2015 final project. The subject of free-to-play games and freemium business models is one that has interested me for a long time. I personally play several games that use these revenue models and have spent (invested?) quote a bit of money in them.

It's been interesting reading the academic research on the subject, particularly the discussions of user behavior, and recognizing the patterns that I or my social groups have exhibited.

This project is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/milescrabill/hci/tree/gh-pages). The site is built hosted on Github Pages and is generated by [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com).
